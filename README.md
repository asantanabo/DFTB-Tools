# DFTB-Tools

This is a collection of scripts to perform analysis of dftb outputs and an automatic generator of DFTB inputs soon to be included into stk. 

The dftb_analysis_freq.sh script splits and organize the vibrational frequencies to be subsequently plotted in xmgrace or gnuplot. Further analysis like the vibrational density of states can be performed by the code XXXX. 

The dftb_iput_generator.py code is a stand-alone library which produces auomatically input files of the DFTB+ code. This is necessary in high-throughput calculations to automatize the workflow. It will be included into stk in the next months.
